This is a for a program using Tkinter for UI that converts a string of text to morse code.

The code itself is quite simple as it splits the sting into individual characters and then finds 
the position of that character in the alphabet list and then the morse code at the corresponding position 
in the morse_code list.

In the future I would like to alter it so that it actually beeps the morse code at you when you convert it.
I would also like a button where you could practice morse code and have it come up as text on the screen (Maybe in the
future).
